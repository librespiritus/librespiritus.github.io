            Free your Soul
            <br>
            <br>
            Artists using both Light and Sound wish for the chance to create film and their dream into a reality. But with no chance to connect with other artists, have a place or tools to collaborate, and go through the trouble of scheduling with their team, the creation of the dream becomes a nightmare. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Film is an experience which meshes the hearts and minds of individuals through the power of connection, collaboration, and creation of characters, worlds, and stories. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Making film should be no different.
            <br>
            <br>
            Libre Spiritus is determined to help you by forming a community of artists ready to connect, collaborate and create film for this calling. 
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="connecting">
            Whether it be producers, cinematographers, or even a weather consultant, artists cannnot achieve the vision they have for their film alone.
            <br>
            <br>
            At Libre Spiritus we do our very best to create a network of diverse thinkers and dreamers to help create the world you are thinking about. 
            <br>
            <br>
            By connecting with other individual artists, you will be able to expand and enrich the characters, story, and ultimately the world of your film. 
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="collaborating">
            Connecting with other artists is only the first step. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Libre Spiritus is proud to offer work stations for you and your newly connected artists. The creative process is only enhanced with tools such as Wacom Sketch Tablets, Macbooks, Adobe CS, cakes and a hot cup of tea. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Aside from treats and tech goodies, our work stations are filled with loads of fun, excitement, and creative thoughts which have been dreamed and now soon be achieved.  
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="creating">
            The ulimate goal in this process is to create.
            <br>
            <br>
            At Libre Spiritus we work out schedules, scout out locations, find the necessary equipment, and whatever else that may be needed for your creation that awaits. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We want nothing to get in the way of you being able to film immediately in order to make your story, characters, and world that much more real.  
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="compassing">
            Libre Spiritus is part Old English and Latin to describe the idea we are after. To "free your soul."
            <br>
            <br>
            Artists have hard time making their dreams info film primarily because of obstacles such as finding other artists, being able to work with them efficiently, and setting aside time to actually start filming and making the dream into a reality. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Libre Spiritus wishes to ensure that none of these trivial problems occur and that your soul and passion can be focused on helping you succeed in making your film.
